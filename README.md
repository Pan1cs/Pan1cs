# Welcome to my GitHub page!

:wave:

Greetings! My name is Elias. I am a student at the Hive Helsinki code school.  
Currently working Freelance at Welocalize as a Data Analyst.



Firstly I'd like to introduce you to the project that I'm most proud of <a href="https://github.com/Pan1cs/doom_nukem/blob/main/README.md">Doom-Nukem</a>.

## ðŸ’¬ Little about me

I'm an avid disc golfer and a musician. I love a good story, and that's why I enjoy games or watching a movie from one of the old greats.  
At the moment I have a few music projects where I'm Composing, working as a recording technician, mixing and mastering.  
  
When it comes to work, I like to do things right the first time rather than cut corners. Sometimes it means planning can take awhile,
but I've learned it always pays up in the end.  
I really like to work with clean low level code for an example the <a href="https://github.com/Pan1cs/wolf3d"> Wolf-3D</a> project that I made with
<a href="https://github.com/kafkalainen"> Kafkalainen</a>.  


## ðŸ‘¯ Studies
Hive Helsinki Code School is a new kind of school in Finland which relies heavily on a peer-to-peer learning model and is part of the 42 School network.
All the studies before the internship are done with C with very minimal libraries, with the motto "IF YOU NEED SOMETHING CODE IT YOURSELF"

I've finished my Bachelor's studies and I'm looking for work.


## Programming languages I know:
 * C, C++, PhP, Python
 * Html, CSS
