Greetings! My name is Elias. I am a student at the Hive Helsinki code school
Currently working Freelance at Welocalize as a Machine Learning Data Analyst.



Firstly I'd like to forward you to my biggest project yet that involved around nine months of development time from our team.
For a quick overview of the project here's the link.

## ðŸŒ± Studies
Hive Helsinki Code School is a new kind of school in Finland which relies heavily on a peer-to-peer learning model and is part of the 42 School network.
All the studies before the internship are done with C with very minimal libraries, with the motto "IF YOU NEED SOMETHING CODE IT YOURSELF"

I've finished my Bachelor's studies and I'm looking for work.
